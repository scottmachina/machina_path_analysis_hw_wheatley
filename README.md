# Machina Path Analysis Homework
This is submission by Mathew Wheatley for the Machina software interview in April/May 2022. Of the two available problems I choose to complete the [path analysis](https://github.com/Machina-Labs/path_analysis_hw).

This repository consists of a single [Jupyterlabs](https://jupyter.org) notebook and the logs that are being examined. The takaways from the analysis are captured in notes in the [analysis](path_analysis.ipynb) itself. See the 'Wrap up notes' secotion in particular for details.

# Quick Start
Open the [notebook snapshot 2022-05-01](path_analysis_2022_05_01.html) which is a pre-rendered html version of [path_analysis](path_analysis.ipynb). Note the plots are not interactive in the html snapshot.

# Dependencies

- #### Required
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [Jupyterlabs](https://jupyter.org/install)
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
    - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)

- #### Recommended
    - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

# Usage
- #### Option 1
    1. The Jypterlabs editor can be opened by navigating to this repository and running `jupyter-lab`.
    1. Navigate to `path_analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.
- #### Option 2
    1. Open in VS code and use the build in [notebook editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/11/08/custom-notebooks). Note that interactive [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) plots are not supported in VS code notebooks as of 2022/05/01.
