# path_analysis_hw
I'm sitting next to a multi-ton, 6dof, Kuka robot arm. It's not doing what I want it to do.

The robot takes in a list of points and does its best to go to those points in order. The thing is, I just fed it a bunch of points and the robot didn't look right. For instance, there is a section of the path I sent to the robot that is a bunch of circles, and instead of tracing out circles, the robot just sat there unmoving... Something is definitely amiss. 

## The ask
Here's where you come in. I want to know why the robots didn't follow my instructions. Fortunately for us, I managed to save some logs during the run:
 - path.csv These are the points I told the robot to go to. Generally, a bunch of loops in the xy plane. 
 - tracker.csv This is where the robot went as measured by some optical trackers. 

Your task: generate insights. The more graphs and sick visualizations, the better. Generally, what parameters of the input points correlate with error? 

## A word of caution about those logs...
 - The tracker points are logged in the tracker frame of reference. You are going to want to transform those points into the frame of reference of the path. No idea what the transform is between tracker points and the coordinates of the path, but I do know that there is no shear (just rotation and translation).  
 - Remember how I said that the robots don't go where they are supposed to go? Well, that's not entirely true. I threw in some "registration points" at the beginning of the commanded path. You'll notice those as points where the robot is commanded to go-to and dwell-at some positions in space. You can assume that the robot accurately hits those points. This should help transform the tracker readings into the coordinates of the path. 
 - Due to some clock desynchrony, it appears that the time stamps in tracker.csv might be shifted from the time stamps in path.csv. Consider it pretty close, but I'm all ears if you can think of a way to handle that. 
 - The data here is very raw and potentially insufficient for grand conclusions. Do your best, and document your assumptions. 

## Submission
In order to submit the assignment, do the following:
